Since the beginning of time, people have been obsessed with telling stories. The world has
known countless ways of telling them. Ranging from mouth to mouth stories, to stories in
books, pictures, movies, performance, dance, artwork, poetry and much more. Some of them
have been there as long as mankind itself, others are fairly young. We keep searching for
different ways of telling stories because this enables us to tell a story in a way it has not been
told before.

In this age where technology has become so important and widespread, it has also enabled us
to create and tell stories in a new way. A good example of this are 360° videos in Virtual Reality.
It is still a technology which hasn’t been widely explored and still has a long way to go, but
despite this it is really fast growing. And it will be used more in the future once it becomes
more accessible for consumers. 

Virtual Reality is a new and very individual way of telling stories of others which forces the
viewer to engage in the story. You cut yourself off from the rest of the world by putting on the
headset, thus making it possible to fully experience the story. Which is why I think VR is
such a powerful tool to tell a story. On which to quote Jessica Lauretti, vice president of RYOT
Studio Oath's creative studio: "You can't see anything else. So it does have this ability to
transport you to another place, another country, another time." 

This brought along a few challenges when it comes to the ability of telling an immersive story.
Just creating a story didn’t work for VR since the user has a certain freedom. He/she is able to
look wherever he/she wants to. The question that first came up, was then how we could grab
the user’s attention without forcing a story on them. Many other challenges soon emerged:

- Telling a story that happens all around and not just in front of the user
- Distracting the user to look away from something, of towards something
- What to do when the user doesn’t look to the proper direction
- How and when to apply changes in the videos without the user seeing them
- Apply proper sounds to the story which improves the immersion of the story
