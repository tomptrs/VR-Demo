# Design Process

To complete a project of which the goal is to create a creative product or service in a successful way, it’s important to go through all stages of the project step by step. This process is also known as the design process. This process has different stages, and it’s important to spend time
in each phase to make sure your concept is strong enough to deliver the message you want to send across.

The design process has seven steps identified: 

1.define
2.research
3.ideate
4.prototype
5.select,
6.implement
7.learn. 

## Define

At first the problem, goal and target group should be defined. The problem that the project or design should solve should be defined clearly, so that the complete team knows which steps and tasks have to be taken to complete the project successfully. 

## Research
Second comes the research stage, in which information is being gathered around the subject. This includes information about the problem, existing similar products, the target group and problems that might occur.

## Ideate
After this stage, there is the ideating stage. In this stage the goal and target group are defined, and ideas are being gathered through brainstorming. At this point of the process the creativity comes in, and concepts are created. A concept is a relative term, that might need some
explanation. This is important, to make sure all team members are on the same page when talking about the concept. A concept is the fundamental idea behind a campaign. This theme will be used as a starting point for all the products created that relate to the project. There are a few characteristics concepts should have. First, it should match the brand identity and add value to it as well. The identity of a brand is where the target audience can relate to and
represents their norms and values. Apart from that, is should also represent their way of thinking and lifestyle. Of course, this causes attention value for the target audience, which is the second characteristic. This is very important, because your product has to catch the attention of the audience over all the other companies or brands that ask for their attention. Therefore, the way of getting attention should be original and fitting to the profile of the target
audience. By making sure it suits their norms and values and the brand automatically creates attention value, chances are more it will catch the attention of the people you’re trying to reach. Another very important characteristic is mediagenic. A suitable, strong concept can easily be
transferred to other types of media. It should be used a base to build on for other ways to communicate the brand of product. Creating content for other platforms causes attention value and recognizability for your audience, when used in ways that suit the target group. To make sure everyone is on the same page and understand the concept the same way, it’s important to add elements that define and visualize the concept. In our case of a video, this meant a script
and a storyboard. With this material, it’s easier to communicate our concept to our coaches to receive feedback. During the process of creating the concept we have communicated our ideas and visions in brainstorm sessions, so we could clarify the concept. 

## Prototyping
After the ideating stage, the prototyping starts. The ideas are presented to target group and evaluated. After potentially adapting the ideas according to the feedback, the ideas are presented to the client. 

## Selection
The fifth stage is selection, in which the final design for the problem/goal will be proposed. In this stage pros and cons are being compared, and the design which suits best to the requirements will be implemented, which is the sixth stage. The design will now be developed and delivered to the client.

## Learning
After delivering the product or design, there is the last but very important stage called learning. During this stage the process will be evaluated, and all involved will give feedback on both the process and the product. These points of improvements will be taken to the design process in
the following projects.
