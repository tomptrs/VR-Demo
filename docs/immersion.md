# Immersion guide

Many factors can disturb the immersion of a video and impede the feeling of being present.
We listed some examples:

- if you feel way to big or way to small
- if there are sudden cuts and it’s getting obvious that you’re in a video
- if visual effects look unrealistic
- if the video is not stable
- if you’re too far away or too close from the centre of action
- if it’s too dark or too bright

## Camera location

The placement of the camera is important to the story. Therefor, you need to consider which role the person, that is wearing the VR headset, will take in the story. Is it participating or only observing? Also, there is a difference in perspective from which the viewer sees the movie. In
first person perspective the viewer plays the main part in the video, when the surroundings focus and move around the person in this perspective. When the viewer is placed in third person perspective, it’s part of the surroundings and not the main character. This leaves more room and freedom to explore the story evolving around, but might be experienced as less immersive since the viewer does not play and active role in the story. Shall it be imparted by any emotion?
The achieve different feelings and ways of viewing, the camera can be placed in many ways. For birds view it can be hung up on the ceiling or placed on the ground for worms view. It can also be placed on eye height and many other positions. There is great room to explore the different options that can fit the story please the viewer. The different perspectives regarding to height have a lot of influence on how the viewer experiences the video. Frog’s perspective
makes the viewer feel smaller, looking up to its surroundings. This might enhance the feeling of a scary and threatening environment.
In every case the camera should be placed in the centre of activity, to make sure to record an attracting environment out of the perspective of the viewer. It is good to know, that things and people, which are closer to the camera seem more important than what is further away and attracts the interest of the viewer more.

## Audio

Audio is an important part of developing an immersive experience. Spatial audio helps to create a realistic experience 360°. This type of audio changes with the direction the viewer is looking towards. For example, the sound of music from the piano in front of the viewer should change if the viewer decided to look to the right. The sound of the music should now come from the left, so it improves getting used and familiar with the surroundings. By creating audio that will
be perceived as realistic as possible, immersion is improved. Even if the sounds being heard are not realistic, the way it reached the viewer should be as close to the way sounds are being received naturally as possible. This way it helps the viewer to believe it’s real. These natural senses should be a starting point when creating audio.

## Location

Choose a setting that fits in the story and attracts the viewer. You can play with heights or different views, but if the location does not fit the story the immersion will be less.

## Stabilisation

Stabilisation is one of the most important things to keep in mind to create an immersive video. If the video is not stable most of the views get motion sick very fast. It is much easier to get immersed by a stable video, because the viewer can concentrate much better on the content and the attracting surrounding.

## Editing

The stitching and rendering of the videos takes a lot of time. Automatically stitching usually works, but not in all cases. Also programming and
adding after effects in the video need time to be done well and to create a stunning result.

## Distance

Another thing to keep in mind is distance between the camera and objects and people around. The viewer will see the environment from this position, so the camera should be seen as a person when setting up the environment. Placing objects or people in the environment of the video too close to the camera will cause distortion. People standing too close will make the viewer feel uncomfortable. Naturally, the viewer will want to step back, but since the video is
filmed from a fixed position, this will not change the perspective of the viewer, and therefore object or people being too close won’t move away. 

## Guide the viewer
Sound and movement can guide the viewer’s attention. It is important that the viewer gets all important parts of a story and to not miss single parts of it and get confused. Sound, light and movement can guide the viewer's attraction and keep him triggered to the story. When the viewer is looking in a certain direction, sounds from other directions can trigger the viewer to look in that direction. This way you can guide the viewer towards other parts in your video. It’s
a great way to avoid the viewer from roaming around without a goal, which might cause the viewer to miss the core of the video.
